# Final Project

## Project Proposals
The project topic should be selected by browsing the literature and picking up an interesting paper related to bioinformatics to be replicated. You should reimplement the code, rerun it on their datasets and see if you still get the same results. Pick the papers that have accessible and manageable datasets (i.e., don’t pick those that require a GPU data centre, 985 TB of RAM and infinite amounts of disk space!)

## What to submit?
Submit the Github repository containing the project code and the report. You can reuse the assignment repository; just create a project directory there. The project report (in Markdown format) should be named report.md. Submit a poster PDF via Brightspace.

Report should contain the explanation of the project, steps taken to implement the project and the result section comparing your project with the original paper.

IMPORTANT: Do not use LLMs to write your report, or you will get 0 points.

A poster can be made using any software of your choice.

Deadlines & dates
Sun, Nov 2 @ 11.59pm: groups should be formed; projects should be selected.
Tue, Dec 2 @ 11.59pm: project report & poster PDFs due. No extensions will be granted! BONUS DAYS DO NOT APPLY!
Wed, Dec 3 @ 11.30am–12.30pm: presentation day (in classroom)
Everybody is expected to attend the poster session. You should print posters and bring them to the session. I will stroll around the room and chat with each team about their work. You are also encouraged to mingle around and check other people’s projects. You can bring a large poster or just a series of standard letter-sized sheets that can be arranged into a grid.

Some advice
Start early, ideally today. The projects are much harder than the assignments, and it will take you at least two weeks of work to get them done.
(Re-)implement the main idea behind a paper or idea you selected for the main project. Many papers contain lots of plots and experiments. You will be graded on how much you can reproduce/port.
It is perfectly normal if you cannot make your implementation faster, or even if you are not able to come up with the advertised results. Negative results (e.g. I took a hit at the problem, but it turned out to be far from optimal) are also accepted. You will have to justify it in the report, though (why? what went wrong? why is that paper not reproducible?).
Use GitHub or some other VCS to maintain your sanity.
Feel free to use AI, internet resources, libraries and whatnot provided that you properly acknowledge and cite them.
Survey
If you can, please fill this (the last one!) survey as well: https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=d9NhnJSYfEKxOx1qUWYrTus1KZDwou1CqGfJaXKVjY5UNFdVS0Q2UFEzQ0ZaUVdSMFZIWE5JRVExRC4u

Good luck,

## Follow-up Discussions

### Question from: Anonymous Atom
It says that by today "groups should be formed; projects should be selected". Should we submit that somewhere or is it just a time-management thing for ourselves?

### Reply from Ibrahim Numanagić
Send it to me via email. Being few days late is OK.
